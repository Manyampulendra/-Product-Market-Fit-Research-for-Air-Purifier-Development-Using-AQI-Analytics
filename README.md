# 🌏 Product-Market-Fit Research for Air Purifier Development Using AQI Analytics

This repository contains a complete **data-driven market research project** conducted as part of the **Codebasics Resume Project Challenge (#16)**.  
The project focuses on analyzing **India’s air quality (AQI) trends, health outcomes, vehicle adoption, and competitor landscape** to evaluate **product-market fit for air purifier development**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Identify market opportunities, target audience, and optimal product features for air purifiers in India using AQI-driven insights.  
- **Scope:** Primary and secondary data analysis of AQI (2022–2025), health costs, vehicle adoption, demographics, and product benchmarking.  
- **Outcome:** Actionable strategic recommendations for **air purifier design, smart features, and market prioritization**.

- `Google Colab Notebook` → Complete code (Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) + exploratory analysis  
- `PPT Presentation` → Final business presentation summarizing research findings and strategic direction  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Processing
Performed end-to-end data wrangling before analysis:  
- Removed irrelevant/redundant columns, handled missing values through imputation/removal.  
- Standardized vehicle fuel types, disease names, pollutant categories, and state labels.  
- Unified date formats and validated pollutant names.  
- Documented every preprocessing step in the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S-AWnEoD_fs5HMe8_FiZgszFLJb9nq8h#scrollTo=jDRH19Luz-NI).

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights

### 🔹 Primary Analysis
- **Top vs Bottom AQI Regions (2024–25):** Bihar, NCR, Haryana worst → Southern states much cleaner.  
- **Southern States Pollutants:** PM10 & PM2.5 dominate; CO in Karnataka, O₃ in Puducherry.  
- **Weekday vs Weekend AQI:** No uniform trend — varies by city sources/traffic/weather.  
- **Worst Months:** Winter (Oct–Jan) most polluted due to stubble burning + inversion.  
- **Disease Burden:** Diarrheal diseases + food poisoning dominate; dengue/malaria in NE & north.  
- **EV Adoption vs AQI:** EV-heavy states still polluted → EV adoption alone cannot reduce AQI.

### 🔹 Secondary Analysis
- **Vulnerable Groups:** Children <5 and elderly most at risk during AQI spikes (asthma, respiratory cases).  
- **Competitor Benchmarking:**  
  - *Dyson:* premium, multifunction, advanced VOC removal.  
  - *Philips:* balanced performance, smart features, trusted brand.  
  - *Coway:* quiet, durable filters, but lacks smart features.  
- **Population vs AQI:** Large states like Karnataka manage good air quality; AQI not tied to population size alone.  
- **Public Awareness:** Higher in metros (Delhi, Mumbai); limited elsewhere due to outreach and trust issues.  
- **Policy Impact (NCAP, BS-VI):** Mixed results — regional variation, partial success, several hotspots persist.

### 🔹 Critical Insights
- **City Risk Analysis:** Delhi, Kolkata, Noida, Ghaziabad = top priority for interventions and products.  
- **Health Cost Impact:** Delhi faces **>1200 crores/year** in pollution-driven health costs; other metros show high burden too.  
- **Feature Gap Matrix:** Consumers want **multi-pollutant sensors, AQI syncing, portable compact design, energy-efficient modes, health-focused modes** (for kids/elderly).  
- **Consumer Behavior:** Pollution emergencies trigger **spikes in purifier demand** (Delhi, Mumbai, Ludhiana).

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Product Design:**  
   - Multi-pollutant sensing (PM, NO₂, SO₂, VOCs).  
   - Compact & portable designs for urban homes.  
   - Smart syncing with real-time AQI + health-focused modes.  
   - Longer filter life + clear alerts.  

2. **Market Targeting:**  
   - Focus on **high-risk, high-income metros**: Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Kolkata, Greater Noida.  
   - Expand later into Tier-2 cities with education-driven marketing.  

3. **Awareness & Education:**  
   - Build consumer trust with reliable AQI-linked campaigns.  
   - Partner with government clean-air initiatives.
